This is the integrated unit testing framework for Core-based applications and frameworks.

It supports a wide-array of other infrastructure out of the box:

- Any modern web browser
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) (Plain JavaScript Environment)
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (Headless Browser)
- [Testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) (Test Runner)

Writing tests is simple. Just initialize a {core.testrunner.Suite} and call {core.testrunner.Suite#test} for every
function you like to test. Inside that function you are able to chose from an array of assertion helpers as well:

- {core.testrunner.Suite#equal}
- {core.testrunner.Suite#identical}
- {core.testrunner.Suite#ok}
- {core.testrunner.Suite#raises}

### Example:

    var suite = new core.testrunner.Suite("Crypt");

    suite.test("CRC32", function() 
    {  
      this.identical(core.crypt.CRC32.checksum("hello world"), 222957957);
      this.identical(core.crypt.CRC32.checksum("hello world!"), 62177901);
    });

### Usage:

- `jasy source`: Building source version of test suite. Open `source/index.html` in any browser.
- `jasy build`: Building build version of test suite. Open `build/index.html` in any browser.
- `jasy test`: Run the test suite automatically using either NodeJS, PhantomJS or Testem
- `jasy clean`: Basic cleanup of build results and caches
- `jasy distclean`: Full cleanup of all generated or downloaded files

There are a few parameters to `jasy test`:

- `--tool <node|phantom|testem>`: Select the tool to use for automated testing.
- `--target <source|build>`: Select whether either source or build should be tested.
- `--browsers <string>`: Comma separated string of browsers to test via Testem e.g. `chrome,firefox`

It is also possible to execute the tools on your own (when using the skeleton based test suite environment):

- NodeJS: Go to the `source` or `build` directory execute `node node.js`.
- PhantomJS: Go to the `source` or `build` directory execute `phantomjs phantomjs.js`.
- Testem: Go to the project root folder execute `testem -f test/testem.json`. See next section for more info.

### Testem:

Testem is pretty useful for automatically testing range of browsers automatically and repeatedly. Testem is able to run either in full automated "ci" (continous integration) mode or in manual control. In both situations Testem is able to auto detect installed browsers and launching them. 

- Interactive: `testem -f test/testem.json`: Run Testem at default port and waiting for browsers to connect.
- Interactive with launcher: `testem -f test/testem.json -l chrome,firefox`: Run Testem at default port, opening Firefox and Chrome with the Testem-URL and waiting for incoming results.
- Automated (CI): `testem ci -f test/testem.json -l chrome,firefox`: Run Testem in Chrome and Firefox and print results to the terminal.

An example `testem.json` might look like:

    {
      "framework": "custom",
      "test_page" : "test/source/index.html"
    }

The `custom` framework is required for giving full control the the Core test runner. You can also choose the build version BTW:

    {
      "framework": "custom",
      "test_page" : "test/build/index.html"
    }
