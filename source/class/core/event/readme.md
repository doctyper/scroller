Object event system and promise API. 

The offered event mixins allow for making arbitrary classes event supported e.g. with methods like `fireEvent`, `addListener`, etc.

Promises are used to structure asynchronously running code. The promise API in *Core* is fully [Promise A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/) spec compatible and should be able to interact with other promise APIs flawlessly.
