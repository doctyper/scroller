Classes for integrating data from *Jasy* to application based on *Core*. 

*Jasy* supports injecting data for assets (images, stylesheets, templates, etc.), translations and environment settings into the application code. The classes in this package offer the client side API for accessing this data. They also function as endpoints used by *Jasy* for passing data to the client via JavaScript methods like `jasy.Asset.addData()`.
