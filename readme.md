Core - A Fine Foundation for JavaScript Projects
================================================

Core prepares the ground for JavaScript projects. It fills what is missing, fixes what is wrong, adds what is useful. While doing this it is still a pretty lightweight framework which is a good start for all kind of JavaScript projects.

Core was designed to work together with the JavaScript tooling project [Jasy](https://github.com/zynga/jasy).

## Authors

Core was initially developed by [Sebastian Werner](mailto:info@sebastian-werner.net)
and is now continued as an official Zynga OpenSource project.


## Jasy Compatibility

This project is kept compatible with newest development of the [Jasy](http://github.com/zynga/jasy) tooling framework. This means that the newest GitHub versions typically require a recent Jasy version  as well. Take a look at this list to understand what version to choose from:

* **0.8**: Jasy = 0.8.x
* **0.7**: Jasy = 0.7.x
* **0.6**: Jasy = 0.6.x
* **0.5**: Jasy = 0.5.x
